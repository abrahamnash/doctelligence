Accessing personal health information (PHI) is currently a tricky task for a lot of patients across many different countries, regions and localities — this is owed to the institutional implementation of centralised identity architectures, employed by many different providers in the healthcare sector. For example, the requesting of access to personal health information can currently take up to [60 days (HIPAA)](https://privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/hipaa-privacy-rule-patients-rights) by law [ in the USA](https://privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/hipaa-privacy-rule-patients-rights). Though, the focus of these articles won't be on any one healthcare system. 

A patient can visit one provider where their PHI is recorded in one EHR, and, when the patient chooses (or must) visit another provider, they often find they cannot retrieve their PHI. As a result, lab test results, clinical documentation and previous hospital visits are not always communicated. This can lead to ineffective care, inefficient use of patient and physician time and resources, the duplication of treatment and tests, and at worst can cause harm to patients if there were important and undocumented components of their care to consider (e.g. previous treatments, allergies to medications) {nosh:new_open_source_health_charting_system_2017}.

As a proposed solution, patients have in the past decade been provided with access to their personal health information which is held by the healthcare provider in siloed (centralized) databases. This is owned by the provider using a centralised identity architecture which leads to the permissions of access being controlled by the institution — it is this that leads to  institutions "owning" personal healthcare information. In my view, this is a slight misrepresentation of context as it diverts thought from the understanding the issues at hand — from solution finding, to policy adaptation (without a solution). To expect a centralized organization not to protect its shareholding and business does not appreciate the nature of how different structural organizations are inclined to act.

The issue at hand, is that currently up to 50,000 staff in a hospital network can rely on having access to a single EHR system or delivery network for over 5-10 million patients. As a result of this, privacy and security standards for consent, authorisation, single-sign-on, and accounting of disclosures, prove elusive. Providers with centralized identity architectures have found it difficult to meet the needs of security and health information exchange (HIE) networks. A variety of HIE solutions have arisen to enhance the ability for data-exchange to overcome the inability large electronic health records to talk with one another. 

A partnership of healthcare institutions and large EHR providers form a partnership to preserve a centralised identity architecture and ownership for shareholding. Personal health information is seen as an institutional asset to the centralized healhtcare provider as this in part defines the very nature of their existence as I write about here \[A Decomposition of the Healthcare Institution\]. This solutions that centralized identity providers provide is  tactful which plays on the misunderstanding of personal health information as a strategic institutional asset — whilst "data-access" is provided to an individual, it still utilizes a central identity architecture and so the issue of "data-exchange"remains present. Like all things which realise themselves, we do a full circle to come back to a culture of "data-access" — an architecture of data holding  inverse and re-structured to centre on the patient this time, rather than the provider.

Adrian Gropper demonstrates a fundamental re-understanding of personal health information holding which is patient centric. He undoes to a great extent the ability of health data to re-centralize into siloed databases by demonstrating an architecture centred on the concept of the sovereign individual. I'd encourage anyone to read his [white paper](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/7-29-poweringthephysician-patientrelationshipwithblockchainhealthit.pdf) as it holds the keys to which decentralized health care provision can be built. 

If the patient controls the flow of information, they can interact with any healthcare services they wish, without being channeled to services which fall under the proviso of a particular institution. For example, a doctor may not be in a position to guide the selection of pharmaceutical medicines that fall outside the partnerships of that institution. Seeing as the patient now holds their own personal health information, they can utilise basic decision support tools to compare prices on effective variety of medications.

Patient identification has been an integral part to the delivery of safe and effective healthcare services. In the US today, patient identities are managed and resolved through proprietary systems such as the Master Patient Index (MPI) and Enterprise Patient Master Index (EPMI). These systems have implemented sophisticated algorithms to locate or match an existing patient with a set of identifying information obtained from the patient during each visit. However, inconsistencies in patient identifiers, errors in data entries, and similarities between patients in a large hospital database (e.g., identical or similar names, discrepant formats of date of birth, etc) complicate the identifications process and exacerbate patient mismatching, compromising the quality of care and also potentially contributing to incorrect fulfillment of medications. According to a previous study, ten out of 17 medical errors that contribute to approximately 195,000 deaths per year are related to incorrect identifications of patients.

On a national scale, today's practices are insufficient to maintain the quality, security and privacy of PHI {gropper2016powering}. As an industry with an ever growing user base, health care has been challenged with ongoing medical errors that expose patients to serious risks of delayed and incorrect treatments. A key contributor is identification of patients primarily due to discrepancies in collected identifiers that frequently result in double-matched patients. Identities of patients are also inconsistent across different healthcare organizations as many are served by heterogeneous, centralised systems. This has also lead to a patient mismatching problem that endangers the quality of care leading to medical errors {zhangfeasibility}.

As described in {Accessinghealthcareservices} healthcare organizations usually assign their patients with unique patient identifiers, but those identifiers are often unrecognized by other organizations. As a patient moves from one care provider to another, their established profile from the previous provider cannot be easily transferred to the new provider, with each occurrence posing an increased change for error in patient databases such as the {MPI}. This further exposes the exact problems of centralized identity management and their negative impact in the long run.

On the flip side, the patient identification mismatch problem presents an opportunity to consider blockhain-based DID solutions that naturally replace a service-centric model with a user-centric model. DIDs are modelled to build single, unique personal identity profiles that include a collection of verifiable and traceable issuance's of credentials. This model would free patients from having to answer repeated questions during their medical visits or request access to new patient portals when transitioning between various points of care. It would also alleviate providers' workload by expediting the identity verification  and decrease patient mismatch rate due to similar or inconsistent identifiers. Moreover, it can protect patient privacy by allowing them to regain ownership of their identity.
