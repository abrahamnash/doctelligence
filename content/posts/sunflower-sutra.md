Both accessing and exchanging personal health information (PHI) is laborious for patients across many different countries, regions and localities owing to centralised identity architectures.

The requesting of access to personal health information can currently take up to {60 days (HIPAA) in the USA} by law. Centralized identity providers will issue a ploy to provide access under the proviso of accessing a siloed database still owned by the institution. Patients are provided access to health information stored by the institutional provider with all the same identity requirements verification processes. However, this does not readily enhance exchange of PHI for patients seeking a variety of different provision types throughout their lifetimes.

A patient can visit one provider where their PHI is recorded in one EHR, and, when the patient chooses (or must) visit another provider, they often find they cannot retrieve their PHI. As a result, lab test results, clinical documentation and previous hospital visits are not always communicated. This can lead to ineffective care, inefficient use of patient and physician time and resources, the duplication of treatment and tests, and at worst can cause harm to patients if there were important and undocumented components of their care to consider (e.g. previous treatments, allergies to medications) {nosh:new_open_source_health_charting_system_2017}.

A scenario arises whereby fifty-thousand staff can rely on having access to a single EHR system or delivery network for over {5-10 million patients}. As a result of this, privacy and security standards for consent, authorisation, single-sign-on, and accounting of disclosures, prove elusive {gropper2016powering}. Furthermore, practices utilising centralized identity architectures who are responsible for protecting PHI have found it difficult to meet the needs of health information exchange (HIE) networks to resolve this conflict of interest.

On a national scale, today's practices are insufficient to maintain the quality, security and privacy of PHI {gropper2016powering}. As an industry with an ever growing user base, health care has been challenged with ongoing medical errors that expose patients to serious risks of delayed and incorrect treatments. A key contributor is identification of patients primarily due to discrepancies in collected identifiers that frequently result in double-matched patients. Identities of patients are also inconsistent across different healthcare organizations as many are served by heterogeneous, centralised systems. This has also lead to a patient mismatching problem that endangers the quality of care leading to medical errors {zhangfeasibility}.

Patient identification has been an integral part to the delivery of safe and effective healthcare services. In the US today, patient identities are managed and resolved through proprietary systems such as the Master Patient Index (MPI) and Enterprise Patient Master Index (EPMI). These systems have implemented sophisticated algorithms to locate or match an existing patient with a set of identifying information obtained from the patient during each visit. However, inconsistencies in patient identifiers, errors in data entries, and similarities between patients in a large hospital database (e.g., identical or similar names, discrepant formats of date of birth, etc) complicate the identifications process and exacerbate patient mismatching, compromising the quality of care and also potentially contributing to incorrect fulfillment of medications. According to a previous study, ten out of 17 medical errors that contribute to approximately 195,000 deaths per year are related to incorrect identifications of patients.

As described in {Accessinghealthcareservices} healthcare organizations usually assign their patients with unique patient identifiers, but those identifiers are often unrecognized by other organizations. As a patient moves from one care provider to another, their established profile from the previous provider cannot be easily transferred to the new provider, with each occurrence posing an increased change for error in patient databases such as the {MPI}. This further exposes the exact problems of centralized identity management and their negative impact in the long run. On the flip side, the patient identification mismatch problem presents an opportunity to consider blockhain-based DID solutions that naturally replace a service-centric model with a user-centric model. DIDs are modelled to build single, unique personal identity profiles that include a collection of verifiable and traceable issuance's of credentials. This model would free patients from having to answer repeated questions during their medical visits or request access to new patient portals when transitioning between various points of care. It would also alleviate providers' workload by expediting the identity verification  and decrease patient mismatch rate due to similar or inconsistent identifiers. Moreover, it can protect patient privacy by allowing them to regain ownership of their identity.
