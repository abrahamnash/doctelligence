title: Cross-device vs. Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Healthcare
author: Abraham Nash

---
One key distinction to make is between cross-device and cross-silo federated learning architectures.} Cross-device federated learning refers to models being trained on a large number of client personal devices (e.g.\\ mobile/laptop). This is more in keeping with the original intentions of federated learning which was to train on distributed mobile devices. Cross-device federated learning can accommodate a large number of client devices, however, a healthcare architecture to sustain this is not yet proposed. Cross-silo federated learning centres on healthcare consortia (i.e.\\ institutional health networks) that utilise large centralised repositories of health data either locally or on cloud-based servers \\cite{mcmahan2017communicationefficient}.

  
Cross-silo FL architectures typically utilise provider networks with large centralised stores of patient data. A database gateway keeper interacts with the server to accept or reject the joining of a round by admitted parties within a permissioned consortium. Large electronic health record databases will use a central server to aggregate local model updates from a variety of hospitals networked during the federated learning process. These examples are numerous. \\cite{pfohl_dai_heller_2019} focus a federated learning example on in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay across an institutional network of thirty one hospitals. An article published in Nature specifically details a centralised federated learning architecture facilitating multi-institutional collaborations without sharing patient data \\cite{sheller2020federated}. A workshop paper published by Consensys (an enterprise offshoot of ethereum) specifically outlined an enterprise architecture to foster federated learning across healthcare consortia \\cite{passeratpalmbach2019blockchainorchestrated}.

Cross-device FL allows access to an individual's data (e.g.\\ personal health information) held on their devices whilst maintaining an individual's privacy \\cite{konecny2015federated}. This allows one to build models which address healthcare challenges common to an entire community of patients with similar conditions; rather than populations limited by the data held on institutional silos \\cite{ma2020federated}. Overall, the patient remains the owner of their own databases as they specify read and write access recorded in a public ledger. It is important to note that the literature this current paper draws upon so far are under the premise of centralised FL architectures as there are no truly dencentralised cross-device FL examples in healthcare \\cite{lee2018privacy, Kim_2017, liu2019twostage, balelli2021probabilistic, fed-biomed, chakravarty_kar_sethuraman_sheet_2021}.

Despite the apparent application of these minimisation principles, modern computational techniques such as federated learning (FL) have not yet been implemented in healthcare industries to reflect the techniques intended conception (i.e.\\ at edge devices). Due to the lack of understanding towards the real world healthcare structures, there remains a mismatch between healthcare provision and decentralized computational techniques such as federated learning \\cite{gropper2016powering}.

Centralised healthcare institutions create siloed databases reflecting their network of providers and storing of personal health information that uses a large EHR provider. This leaves little data being available to researchers and companies from relatively few institutions and geographic regions comprising limited patient demographics. Thus, federated learning techniques become re-adjusted to mimic these centralised structures which alters the architectures of FL systems to meet these requirements. As a result of this, we see no current edge device FL in the healthcare sector. This lack of understanding is clear, and can be demonstrated in papers seeking to outline frameworks to using modern cryptography to decentralize healthcare data access on the blockhain as described here \[insert consensus\]. Because of this, much of the modern research has no other choice but to enter into cross-institutional collaboration in the retrieval of healthcare data. \\cite{lee2018privacy, Kim_2017, liu2019twostage, balelli2021probabilistic, fed-biomed, chakravarty_kar_sethuraman_sheet_2021}.
