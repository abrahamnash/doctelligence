title: Why Blockchain-Based Federated Learning in Healthcare?
author: Abraham Nash

---
A public blockchain is an important consideration for preserving decentralized structures in healthcare, that enable patients to utilise sovereign-identities in a decentralized network of other sovereign-identity-based individuals.

A number of efforts steer away from an understanding of real-world health architectures with suggestions for permissioned blockchains. This would lead to a recentralization of health care as was previously fostered by centralized insterests — see here \[reference blog on centralization of healthcare institutions\].

Examples of these efforts are spread everywhere such as \[permissioned\], here \[private\] and here. Furthermore, when it comes to incentivising patient-in-the-loop (or even provider-in-the-loop) then we see some sort of middle-party intervene to centralize the data-source somehow. All these fall short, however, of realising a truly decentralized healthcare system. To elaborate on this, I publish a white-paper in a proposal for 'a decentralized intelligence health network', focusing on a public blockchain based aggregator-free federated learning architecture which aligns with self-sovereign frameworks in healthcare (coined first by Adrian Gropper in HIE of One) — see here.

Medrec developed by Nchinda Nchinda and his group first lead the effort in recoginizing that the blockchain could be used to store a record of policies which meant the individual patient controlled access permission to a stored repository of personal health information. This permission based system was performed accross a private blockchain shared within a network of hospital providers which formed an institution.

Next, other efforts have sought to advance these efforts — we see this \[\], this \[\] and this \[\]. For the same reason, these architectures do not quite reach an equilibrium of understanding in regards to true decentralization.

Adrian Groppers work then defined an architecture whichc did not rely on the blockchain to create permissions policy. Instead, they coded these permissions into-server based policies to be used by individual patients. They then worked upon self-sovereign identification as a central theme in delivering the first seperation of healthcare records access from institutions. To demonstrate this — available here \[youtube\] amd here \[yotube\] Adrian Gropper utilised a decenralized identifier (i.e. hash) application called uPort \[insert uport\] which enables a professional to utilize a self-sovereign identity and attribute a credential to this idntity through a third party validator (e.g. doximity). These are required to grant access permission to a patients PHR where such policies can be automated. I talked about this here \[earlier blog link\].
