title: A Decomposition of the Centralized Healthcare Institution
author: Abraham Nash

Originally, physicians would use paper records and store these at their practices. The recording of personal health information then shifted to electronic health records. As the healthcare industry transitioned from paper to digital, larger practices merged as this offset the costs of EHRs for physicians to practice as they are typically housed and maintained by the institution. Over time, the value of data has been realised which transformed the holding of personal health information into a strategic shareholding asset which in part is responsible for defining the modern healthcare institution as it is â€” centralized . 

Centralised healthcare providers have expressed their concern about the loss of patients and associated revenue that could result from sharing data with competitor organizations and generally, uncertainyly about the return on investmentfrom prioritizing HIE ahead of other investements \\cite{grossman2008creating}. Health Information Exchange (HIE) has remained slow \\cite{adler2015electronic} as ensuring that both providers and EHR vendors maintain their financial incentives has proven challenging. 

As healthcare institutions grew, an imbalance of IT purchasing power in favour of large-scale EHR vendors and providers was selected which makes it difficult for individual, small and medium sized practices to exist on their own. A variety of high level panels (i.e.\\ JSON, PCAST) recommended separating access control from personal health record stewardship (i.e. cross-silo networks) to achieve interoperability at scale {gropper2016powering}. Yet this is not in-keeping with the growth pattern of centralised healthcare providers, who as stakeholders, are required to hold and acquire patient health data as strategic institutional assets {nosh:new_open_source_health_charting_system_2017}.Hence, many providers will have different EHR versions which render the idea of interoperability too difficult to realise {ekblaw2016case}.Thus, a focus on in_eroperability and open standards sch as "Health Level 7 (HL7) C-CDA"_{healthit.gov_2019} is trying to fit two things together which do not want to be.

This places physicians in a difficult position as they are unable to afford health record systems which suit creative individual, small to medium sized practices. This leaves physicians beholden to centralised institutions of healthcare with little autonomy in practice. For example, physicians are unable to refer patients to services not affiliated with the institution (i.e.\\ pharmaceutical medications, imaging and lab services) and this can leave patients without cost-effective options.

In the era of modern data utilisation, this more importantly can stifle clinical practice as physicians seeking to adopt machine learning algorithms into their clinical care pathways are not in the position to directly facilitate expenditure on these integrations. As this blog highlights, neither are cross-silo institutional databases in the position to realise the value of health data in the first place.
